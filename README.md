# Unlock Main Levels

<img src="logo.png" width="150" alt="the mod's logo" />

A mod to unlock the locked main demon levels, even if you don't have enough secret coins.  
  
  
I was confused as to why this wasn't on the Geode index already, but then I realized that the only reasonable way that I can think of to do it is incredibly scuffed and no other programmer would stoop as low as to use it.  
But I'm new to C++ and GD modding. That's my excuse. :P  
  
(Jokes aside, it's really not that bad. Just a bit hacky.)
